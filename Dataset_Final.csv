"13","Decentralization unlocks local governance and builds local trust.

Last week, and Ukrainian Institute had the great honour and joy of hosting a discussion on Community Resilience During Wartime with Tymofii Brik, a Ukrainian sociologist and the current Rector of the Kyiv School of Economics, at Leiden University - Institute of Public Administration.

🔍 Brik’s recent research explores 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐔𝐤𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐫, 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐬.

One of the key outcomes of Ukraine’s 2015–2019 decentralization reform - which significantly expanded local autonomy and strong civic participation in budgeting - was a measurable increase in social capital. 

This transformation was critical in Ukraine’s wartime resilience. These decentralization reforms empowered local governance, fostered trust, and enabled communities not just to endure but to act with agency, strength, and effectiveness. 

Thank you Tymofii and the Ukrainian Institute for helping us hold this important talk and to all attendees for coming. It is through our diverse membership that ABBA aims to empower our communities, Ukrainian and otherwise, in The Netherlands and Europe.

"24","🇸🇰 Slovakia – a land of vibrant culture, breathtaking mountain views and delicious cuisine, offering much to weary travelers in every inn and town. Locals tell tales of mysteries lurking in the woods, highwaymen patrolling the roads and mountains hiding treasures. That is where you come in – curious, adventurous and broke beyond good taste. As you sit in one of the inns, hoping to scramble last coins for a cup of mead, a tale hits your ears. A tale of a treasure, laying in the depths of Navia – Hell itself, where no man or woman dares to venture alone.

🎲 This is your chance to explore Slovak folklore and raid Hell itself by the side of Robin Hood of Eastern Europe – the legendary Slovak highwayman, Yuray Yanosik. Bring on your creative mind and create a character that reflects your internal thief – a sneaky rouge, a disgraced noble, a heartbroken bard? Your imagination is the limit! Be ready to leverage your charm, charisma and creativity to tackle challenges, engage enemies and find your way into secured vaults. But beware, as you will not only be faced with locked doors and high walls. In the end the true test will take form of your own morality and trust in your fellow companions.

1️⃣ Spread awareness of member states’ culture, and traditions.

For years, Eastern European countries have gotten little coverage within university curricula. By starting this association, we aim to raise awareness of our countries’ present-day achievements, as well as historical and cultural richness, through events, discussions, and festivals.

2️⃣ Promote an academic focus on member states’ political and historical developments.

When viewing developments of our countries, little is known to the general public outside of the headline stories. We strive to share knowledge of the intricate workings of our histories and political systems through an academic lens to provide greater context and deeper understanding.

3️⃣ Maintain attention on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

For more than a year, Ukraine has been bravely defending its right to freedom and democracy. We aim to do everything possible to support Ukrainian students and to remind our communities about the hardships Ukrainian people are facing.

📜 Danube’s waters flow under the dark sky, its surface barely disturbed as a heavy mist coils above it. The Bulgarian shore, a rugged stretch of marsh and fishing docks, bustles by day with trade and toil - boats ferrying goods, fishermen hauling in their catch, smugglers slipping unseen through the reeds. Official trade is slow, taxed into stagnation, but the river has always carried more than what is written on ledgers. You find yourselves aboard a crude wooden raft, its planks damp and creaking under the weight of smuggled cargo. Stacked crates, some marked, some suspiciously bare of any labels, shift slightly as the raft drifts down the current. How you ended up here is a matter of your own choices - or mistakes. Regardless, you’ve been hired as protection, watching the mist for more than just patrols. Your eyes do not cut the dark water's surface – what lays below, does not want to be seen. Not until it can see you. A primal force you can’t negotiate with, always hungry, leaves its lair, and finds you",1,"https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/486743411_964228588800808_966165292598092041_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGi4bAFBpZOHQ_yGZG9eAzsP8pvB3_3-twjmzzmisaMXJ7tTxd4-kQFUm0P22Yl-XiQlzWnGEjPjVlnXYYEZhH3&_nc_ohc=XkZig-Vmu_IQ7kNvwG_mrPh&_nc_gid=Z0s_FU9ni9HFrluGjXyZ1A&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfcIf7eZwNjm_R824eXhhiM-TF_jeaT3mkguMQhKS1pJVQ&oe=690569A8&_nc_sid=10d13b","🔥🔥",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://www.instagram.com/abba.association.leiden","false",NA,"false",37,NA,"abba.association.leiden",NA,"2025-03-27T13:48:02.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtHwOICSUZ/",NA,2025-03-27,2,"Social",0,1,0,1,0,0,0

"42","🇺🇦 Q&A with a Foreign Fighter: Meet Alvis Lukša, Former Leiden University Student & Officer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine

🤔 Just 3 years ago, Alvis Lukša was a student at Leiden University, studying Security Studies. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he made a life-altering decision — to put his studies on hold and join Ukraine’s Territorial Defense, later becoming an officer in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

🎤 In this rare and deeply personal conversation, Alvis will share his journey from university halls to the frontlines. 

❓ How does war change a person? What does it mean to defend a country that isn’t your birthplace, but has become your cause? What can students and young professionals learn from his experience?

You just say ""the movie promotes Russian propaganda"", but do not specify how. It is because the only propaganda in the movie comes from the interviewed soldiers, who are being asked their opinion on the war and why they are in Ukraine to kill - I cannot see propaganda by filmmakers, they are just showing the life on the Russian side of the front. 2. Illegal filmmaking - do you think the Oscar winners, who was filming the Israli-Palestinian war didn't break any international law there?and to be honest - the filmmaking was not fully legal also according to the Russian authorities, so they do not respect neither the Russian laws. 3. Ignorés war crimes. This one is just stupid: If the filmmaker couldn't find any war crimes on her trip, that doesn't mean she hid them on purpose - Russians (for the most) do not just have dead Ukrainian children and killed war prisoners every 10 meters, they are hidden and not too easy to find.. At the end the film is just viewing, without commentaires the view of the Russian soldiers on the war. Now we can see, how stupid they in many places are and we can better understand how to defeat them.

We joined an informative session with MEP Javi Lopez, discussing the revision of the Ambient Air Quality Directive and its crucial implementation for the future of our planet.
This visit, was facilitated by @yeenetwork , which provides a platform for youth activism connected to the environment.🌱

Why does air quality matter for the countries of the Adriatic, Baltic, Black, and Azov seas regions? Our regions share unique ecosystems but also interconnected challenges. Air pollution doesn’t stop at borders—it harms biodiversity, human health, and the climate we all share.
Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in the EU, causing chronic illnesses and premature deaths. Tackling it isn’t just about statistics—it’s about protecting our communities and lives, simultaneously ensuring a healthier future for generations to come.

With this informative reel we want to invite you to not shy away from environmental topics and youth activism, because YOUR voice truly matters.👥

We want to pay tribute to the defenders of Ukraine while encouraging youth to remain actively engaged in supporting Ukraine’s resistance against the aggressor.

In this context, we encourage to also be aware of the connotations in academia that undermine the notions of sovereignty and independence. The attention has been brought to the regional maps of “Europe” and “russia and Eurasia” displayed at the Area Fair for International Studies students of Leiden University on November 1. Baltic States are placed within the map of “russia and Eurasia,” while unacceptably being entirely omitted from the map of Europe. Such depictions not only fail to reflect the geopolitical realities and internationally established territorial units but also risk perpetuating narratives that undermine the principles of independence and self-determination, principles that are central to academic integrity and responsible scholarship.

NEEDED: Brave souls for a well-paid, but perilous task. Riches await those who dare to retrieve an ancient relic of immeasurable significance – the Kraboshka mask of Veles’ priest. I – Rovy Kopach, a famed treasure hunter and explorer - offer you a chance to immortalize your name on the pages of history and contribute to the biggest exploit the world has ever seen. I await you in the Honey Comb Tavern in Rostaye. Ask the innkeeper for a cup of warm mead with gooseberries and he shall point you to me. But beware, as the task is not easy. The quest will take you not only into a dangerous Kurhan, through traps and challenges, but also put you face to face with Death – literary.

📜 The year is 1881—technological achievements slowly, but steadily, push the magic away from daily life—gunpowder becomes a substitute for offensive spells, steam engines gain popularity over magical mounts, modern medicine competes with healing wards and enchantments. But the world is not yet free of all manners of plagues, magical beings and mysteries. You find yourself in Romania, clenching a poster in your hand. As the steam train, fueled by fire and water mages at the locomotive, moves across gloomy yet beautiful Carpathian landscape, you read the poster one last time:
A hefty reward for any soul that will aid us in our time of need. The Bosov Asylum—once a place of pride—faces an unclassified sickness. I call upon those strong of heart, sharp of mind, and willing to confront the unknown. We need help beyond what medicine can offer—help to uncover the mystery that now holds our asylum in a vice of fear. If you possess the resolve to face the unnatural and the bravery to challenge your own weakness, I implore you to come to us with haste. Your reward will be gold, but more importantly it will be the salvation of countless innocent souls and the restoration of peace to this tormented place.
Chief of Bosov Asylum
Dr V. Ionescu
The path ahead is not clear. How this will end depends only on your wit and resolve. While you have companions, the only one who will not leave your side on this journey...is your own fear.

1️⃣ Spread awareness of member states’ culture, and traditions.

For years, Eastern European countries have gotten little coverage within university curricula. By starting this association, we aim to raise awareness of our countries’ present-day achievements, as well as historical and cultural richness, through events, discussions, and festivals.

2️⃣ Promote an academic focus on member states' political and historical developments.

When viewing developments of our countries, little is known to the general public outside of the headline stories. We strive to share knowledge of the intricate workings of our histories and political systems through an academic lens to provide greater context and deeper understanding.

3️⃣ Maintain attention on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

For more than a year, Ukraine has been bravely defending its right to freedom and democracy. We aim to do everything possible to support Ukrainian students and to remind our communities about the hardships Ukrainian people are facing.

❗️ Our main goals are: 

1️⃣: Spread awareness of member countries' politics, culture, and history among LU students. 

For years, Eastern Europe got little-to-no coverage in university curricula and student-led events. By starting this association, we aim to raise awareness of our countries’ present-day achievements, as well as historical and cultural richness, through events, discussions, and festivals. 

2️⃣: Promote an academic focus on member states' political developments. 

Some of our countries’ political developments have stricken the news, however, little is known to the general public besides the headlines. We strive to share the knowledge of the intricate workings of our politics through an academic lens here at LU. 

3️⃣: Maintain attention on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

For more than a year, Ukraine has been bravely defending its right to freedom and democracy. We aim to do everything possible to support Ukrainian students and to remind the LU community about the hardships that Ukrainian people face.
